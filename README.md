  <h2 style="color: #2563eb;">üß† Explanation of the Game</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Blackjack</strong>, often known as <strong>21</strong>, is a card game where the player competes against the dealer
    with the goal of having the total value of their cards come as close to <strong>21</strong> as possible without exceeding it.
    Here's a detailed breakdown of how the game works and the rules you'll implement:
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #334155; margin-top: 1.5em;">üé¥ Game Setup</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5em;">
    <li>The game uses a standard deck of <strong>52 playing cards</strong>.</li>
    <li>Each card has a value:
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle; padding-left: 1.5em;">
        <li>Number cards (<strong>2 through 10</strong>) are worth their face value.</li>
        <li>Face cards (<strong>Jack, Queen, King</strong>) are each worth 10.</li>
        <li><strong>Aces</strong> can be worth either <strong>1</strong> or <strong>11</strong>, depending on which value benefits the player‚Äôs hand the most.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The player starts with a bankroll of <strong>$100</strong>.</li>
    <li>Before each round, the player places a bet. If the player runs out of money, the game ends.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color: #334155; margin-top: 1.5em;">‚ô†Ô∏è Game Flow</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5em;">
    <li><strong>Placing Bets:</strong> The player decides how much to bet from their available funds.</li>
    <li><strong>Dealing Cards:</strong> Initially, both the player and the dealer are dealt two cards.
      The player's cards are both face up, while the dealer has one card face up and one face down (hidden).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 style="color: #475569; margin-top: 1em;">üßç Player's Turn</h4>
  <ul style="list-style-type: circle; padding-left: 1.5em;">
    <li>
      If the player's initial two cards total <strong>21</strong> (an Ace and a 10-value card),
      this is called a <strong>"Blackjack"</strong>. The player wins <strong>3:2</strong> on their bet immediately,
      unless the dealer also has a Blackjack, in which case the game ends.
    </li>
    <li>
      If not a Blackjack, the player has the option to <strong>"Hit"</strong> (request additional cards)
      one at a time to try to get closer to 21. The player can hit as many times as they like but will
      <strong>"Bust"</strong> (automatically lose) if their total exceeds 21.
    </li>
    <li>
      The player can also <strong>"Stand"</strong> (not take any more cards) if they are satisfied with their hand‚Äôs total value.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 style="color: #475569; margin-top: 1em;">üÉè Dealer's Turn</h4>
  <ul style="list-style-type: circle; padding-left: 1.5em;">
    <li>
      After the player stands, the dealer reveals their hidden card.
      The dealer must <strong>Hit</strong> if their total is less than <strong>17</strong>
      and <strong>Stand</strong> once it reaches <strong>17 or more</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color: #334155; margin-top: 1.5em;">üèÜ Determining the Winner</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5em;">
    <li>
      If the <strong>dealer busts</strong> or the <strong>player's total</strong> is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21,
      the player <strong>wins</strong> and doubles their bet.
    </li>
    <li>
      If both the player and the dealer have the <strong>same total</strong>, the game is a
      <strong>"Push"</strong> (tie), and the player's bet is returned.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the <strong>dealer has a higher total</strong> than the player without busting,
      or if the player busts, the player <strong>loses</strong> their bet.
    </li>
  </ul>
